## The back-office

Our website has a dedicated back-office in which properly authenticated users can access and manage data stored in our database. To go to the login page for the back-office, go to (http://wjacques.tech/admin/login).


Once there, you can either login with a pre-existing account or signup with a new one. We will authenticate your account and determine which role to attach it to, if any. What you can and cannot access in the back-office is purely determined by the role privileges you have.


The back-office authentication is mainly done with the [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) gem.

The back-office interface itself is done with the [ActiveAdmin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) gem.


### Accounts

All accounts are defaulted with the password `password`.


Here's a pre-existing Employee account you could log into:

- Email: nicolas.genest@codeboxx.biz

- Password: `password`



## Linked MySQL database

The MySQL database we started last week was completed this week with more tables that were seeded to simulate a functioning company with more than 40 years experience:

1. A leads table consists of a list of all the messages and contact forms sent through the website. containing information pertaining to all the fields from the original contact form and the file is saved as a binary file.

2. an Address table is a reference table for all the addresses used in the other tables it is linked to the customer and the buildings tables with the has_many command

3. A customers Table references all Rocket elevators Customers and is linked the AdminUser table allowing them to connect and have a specific view. it also owns (has_many) buildings

4. A buildings table has an address (belongs_to) and owns (has_many) building_details and also

5. Batteries who in turn own

6. Columns who own

7. Elevators

8. Finally the quote table table has been populated with data to correspond with the buildings they represent. The seed uses ruby programming language and a gem called [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) to populate the database with random data.



## Data Warehouse (w/ PostgreSQL)



In order to be able to export data from MYSQL to POSTGRESQL you'll have to:

1. Browse in the the folders "lib/tasks/export.rake" and make sure that you are connected to right dbname.

2. Choose line 18 if you're running in you local machine or line 19 if you're running on the Codeboxx server and comment the one you're not using.

3. Please make sure you do the same for line "46 - 47", "66 - 67", and "89 - 90".

4. Go to your terminal.

5. Create the tables by running this commande `rake second:db:create && rake second:db:migrate`.

6. To export the data you'll run this second commande `rake export:datawarehouse`.

7. Go to the POSTGRESQL terminal by typing `psql postgres`.

8. Type " \l" to list all your databases then " \c datawarehouse_development " to get into our database.

9. Type " \dt+" to list all the tables you should see " dimcustomers, factquote, factcontact, factelevator".

10. Type " SELECT * FROM 'name of the table you want to see' ;" don't forget the " ; " before hitting "Enter".

11. You will have all the data for each table.

## Queries

To analyze the business situation of the company for each month every year, we have extracted the necessary information from data warehouse (Postgresql) by using SQL queries: SELECT, SELECT distinct, FROM, GROUP BY, ORDER BY. Below are our queries to answer 6 questions:


#### 1. How many contact requests are made per month?


select date_part('year', creation_date) as year, date_part('month', creation_date) as month, count(id)


from factcontactC

group by year, month


order by year, month;


#### 2. How many bid solicitations are made per month?


select date_part('year', creation) as year, date_part('month', creation) as month, count(id)


from factquote


group by year, month
​
order by year, month;



#### 3. How many elevators per customer do we have?

select company_name, sum(nb_elevator) as number_of_elevators

from dimcustomers

group by company_name

order by number_of_elevators desc;

#### 4. The number of unique requests (ContactId) grouped by Month (Creation Date)?

select distinct id, date_part('year', creation_date) as year, date_part('month', creation_date) as month

from factcontact

group by id, year, month

order by year, month;

#### 5. The number of unique requests (QuoteId) grouped by Month (Creation Date)

select distinct id, date_part('year', creation) as year, date_part('month', creation) as month

from factquote

group by id, year, month

order by year, month;

#### 6. The number of elevators (ElevatorId) contained in the buildings belonging to each customer

select customer_id, building_id, count(id)

from factelevator

group by building_id, customer_id

order by building_id, customer_id;

  
## APIs
