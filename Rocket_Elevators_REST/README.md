# Rocket_Elevators_REST

This repo contains all the code for the RESTful API in .NET Core from Week 8 of Odyssey.


- The URL for this API deployed on Azure is : https://apirocketelevators.azurewebsites.net 

A REST API

In order to connect our information system to the equipment in operation throughout the territory served, we first need to develop a REST API using C # and .ASP NET. It will allow us to know and to manipulate the status of all the relevant entities of the operational database.

>  To retrieve the status of a specific battery, column or elevator, use GET with one of the following  endpoints:

  `/api/battery/{battery_id}`
  `/api/column/{column_id}`
  `/api/elevator/{elevator_id}`
    
    
  > To change the status of a specific battery, column or elevator, use PUT with the following endpoints:
  
  `/api/battery/{battery_id}`
  `/api/column/{column_id}`
  `/api/elevator/{elevator_id}`
  
  In Postman, in the Body section, you have to use raw JSON and give a value for the corresponding ID and the desired status.
